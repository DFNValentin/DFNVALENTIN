### Hello There 👋🏻

I believe you're here for a reason, whether you're just exploring or seeking something specific. My name is Edi, and yes, I'm another "programmer" who loves "programming."

My journey began in 2022 with Python as my first programming language. Since then, a lot has changed, and I've continued to grow... kind of.
